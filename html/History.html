<H1>History of the department</H1>
<p>
The latest history of our department starts in 2002 when it was formed by integration of two departments: "Automatic Control Systems" and "Computer Engineering and Automated Management" departments. But practically everything began much earlier. 
</p>
<H2>1953</H2>
<p>
The significance of this date is defined by the foundation of the Institute Of Mines in our city governed by M.N. Dedyukin who was appointed its first rector. The history has already begun but no one dreams neither of the university nor of the department of the informational technologies though.

This year the Gyroscopic Devices Department (the director - professor R.A. Abramov)  and the Automatics and Telemechanics department (the director - professor M.S. Ter-Mkhitarov) appear. 
</P>
<H2>1960</H2>
<P>
1960 is the year of the foundation of the Perm Polytechnic Institute on the basis of the Institute Of Mines. M.N. Dedyukin is appointed the first rector of the institute. The technical faculty of the Perm State University and the Engineering Night Institute soon become a part of the new Institute. And what's more this year the Electrotechnical faculty (the dean - the professor I.F. Burlak) including the Gyroscopic Devices department, Automated Electric Drive, Automatics and Telemechanics  department and some others departments is formed. 
</P>
<H2>1961</H2>
<P>
The Automated Electric Drive department is founded inside the Electrotechnical Faculty (the director - the professor B.M. Stolbov; nowadays this department is known as the Microprocessor Automation Department). The club of the international friendship "Fakel" ("Torch") is organized. The construction of the first building of the Institute is completed.

The department of Automated Electric Drive, Automatics and Telemechanics is divided into two departments: Computer Engineering and Automated Management  department (the director - the professor M.S.  Ter-Mkhitarov) the appearance of which was determined by commissioning the computer and Automatics and Telemechanics department which is the ancestor of the main departments of the modern Electrotechnical Faculty. Since then this faculty has graduated more than 2000 engineers. Nowadays the process of integrating into the European educational system has made the department accept the two-level form of education graduating both bachelors and engineers who have received a master's degree.

<p>
The Computer Engineering and Automated Management  department even according to its title had to deal with the computing facilities in the educational process as well as scientific investigations. That's why the research laboratory is the special pride of the department.
</p>

Anyways the rapid progress in the computer development made the process of the computerizing of the department the greatest and the most controversial issue. The attempts to define the most preferable way of the department equipping have caused the coexisting of the primitive - according to the modern vision - computers (for example "Promin", "Nairi", "Mir") which were the first ones to form the laboratory equipment and rather powerful computers (for example "ES" or "Unified Series") that appeared later. 

<h2>1970</h2>
<P>
The main achievement of this period is the foundation of the new university campus on the right bank of the Kama river (while the main building is situated on the left one). Added to this the usage of the computers in the process of the projection of the term papers at Machinery department is begun.

<h2>1971</h2>
<p>                                
According to the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council Of Ministers the Perm Polytechnic Institute as one of the leading universities of the country has to begin educating a new profession - Automatic Control Systems. This action had been recognized a necessary measure capable to improve the economics of the country.
</p>
<p>
As a result of this decision the first two groups of students are formed in spring at Computer Engineering and Automated Management department. Anyways the order is received already in October to graduate the first specialists during the current school year. This embarrassing command is received by all the universities of the country where the new Automatic Control Systems department had been opened.
</p>
<p>
After the graduation of several groups of students it's decided to form a special Automatic Control Systems department that used to be a part of the Computer Engineering and Automated Management department till then. In spite of a long period of independent development of these departments Oleg Belanovich Nizamutdinov the first head of the Automatic Control Systems department used to emphasize their common origin. 
<br>
</p>
<H2>1972</H2>
 
The laboratory equipment is enriched because of the appearance of the first small digital computer. It might be regarded as rather a progressive event as the new computer's in size of an average writing table and requires neither technical servicing nor special cooling system. The computer program is entered with special set of plugs, each of them corresponds to a one command determining its code by the apertures of the metal part of the plug. The plugs are set into the special rulers situated in the upper part of the table and the results of the calculations are seen in the electronic indicator board.

<p>
The total computerization of the 70-ies influences the Higher Educational Ministry of the Soviet Union as well as the Higher Educational Ministry of the Russian Federative Republic, the higher school is involved into the automation process. According to a computerization program lots of universities receive computers appropriate for educational aims, for example the Perm Polytechnic Institute gets a "M-222". Although this computer type being one of the best and most beautiful soviet digital computers of this period was not oriented on data handling it becomes rather popular equipment of university laboratories. That's why the high schools that have received such computers begin common investigations trying to exploit them in the field of management.
</p>
<p>
 As for our Institute these research is conducted by two command: a group of &quot;M-222&quot; programmers and a group of specialists from the Computer Engineering and Automated Management department who act in correspondence to the order of the university administration and even the rector M.N. Dedyukin is thought to be interested in the results of the investigations.
</p>
<p>
In 1972-76 the educational process at the Automatic Control Systems department (the head of the department - M.S. Ter-Mkhitarov) is organized by professor I.D. Kolodny, professor V.D. Mukhin, professor A.L. Goldschtein, professor A.M. Notkin, professor A.E. Solovyov and research workers of State Control Systems Research Institute (NIIUMS) M.M. Turbovskii, Y.N. Lipin, G.A. Posadkih.

<H2>1973</H2>
<p>
Due to the Computer Engineering and Automated Management department the new digital centre mainly based on territory of the university campus on the left bank of the Kama river is formed.

</TABLE>
<p>
Due to the Computer Engineering and Automated Management department the new digital centre mainly based on territory of the university campus on the left bank of the Kama river is formed. After two years of investigations and continual experiments in spite of all the difficulties a group of the scientists of the Perm Polytechnic Institute (I.D. Kolodny, O.B. Nizamutdinov, V.D. Titov and others) has managed to design a training simulator for operators of the dockside cranes. 
</p>
<p>
Practically this machine derives from a dockside crane &quot;Hanz-5\6-30&quot;. The first simulator is run in 1973 thanks to the leading engineer of the Perm cargo port G.I. Izyumov who has funded the research and construction. This simulator will have been successfully exploited in the Perm cargo port till 1989 and will become a prototype of the later more perfect training machines that will have been constructed at the Computer Engineering and Automated Management department for more than 10 years. And the first patent on the training equipment will be received in 1975 by I.D. Kolodny, B.O. Nizamutdinov, M.S. Ter-Mkhitarov, V.F. Peshekhonov, V.D. Titov, G.I. Izyumov and A.N. Pyankov. Later the number of the licenses will increase. 
</p>
<p>
The economical and educational effect of the realization of the idea of simulator training the crane operators is evident. Owing to simulators the safety of the educational process increases while the number of accidents and the time of education reduces. The university receives a host of applications for the training equipment from various sea and river harbors, the Navy Ministry of the USSR and the River Transport Ministry of the Russian republic are interested in the further investigations as well.  Some time later the analogue modeling in the simulator will be changed for digital one, thus due to the creative work of I.D. Sharybin the construction costs will be decreased and the reliability will rise simultaneously.
</p>
<p>                                                                          
 The training equipment constructed at the Perm Polytechnic Institute has been successfully exhibited in Saint-Petersburg at an international forum of the companies producing the harbor machinery as well as at the international exhibitions in Germany and Finland. Four scientists (V.M. Vasilyev, V.A. Zhilin, I.D. Kolodny, M.S. Ter-Mkhitarov) have been awarded medals of Moscow VDNH Exhibition (Exhibition Of The Achievements Of The National Economics).

It's worth to emphasize that the investigations in the field of the training equipment have been conducted with the help of the modern - for that period - digital technics on the basis of the Automatics and Telemechanics department (later on the basis of Computer Engineering and Automated Management department). 
</p>
<p>
The development of the scientific and design works in the field of computer technologies was influenced greatly by Scientific conferences conducted by Computer Engineering and Automated Management department together with the Perm regional Applied Mathematics And Computer Engineering committee. Beyond the researchers of the Perm Polytechnic Institute and the specialists of the Perm region some representatives from the Moscow, St. Petersburg, Sverdlovsk and other significant scientific institutions used to take part in the conferences as well. The last of those conferences - the 23rd one - took place in 1989.
</p>
<p>
 New methodic manuals aimed to simplify the research process in the special Management Theory laboratory were designed by V.G. Kolomyvtzev and his colleagues from the Computer Engineering and Automated Management department. Lots of specialists from all over the country used to pay attention to this laboratory because of the modern equipment. The main founder of the laboratory V.G. Kolomyvtzev (nowadays PhD and professor) still teachs his subject at the Electrotechnic Faculty.   
</p>
<H2>1974</H2>

<p>
Due to the Automatic Control Systems department (the director - professor O.B. Nizamutdinov) a design office is organized as a functional department of one of the local factories; the newly founded office deals with real manufacturing and constructed electronic equipment according to a formal work plan. 
</p>
<p>
In the early 70-ies while the computer techniques cease being just the equipment of a few experimental laboratories but become gaining importance as a significant part of the manufacturing process the specialists intend to use computers in the field of management and economical analysis of the work of the public enterprise beyond conducting engineering and scientific calculations. This process is typical not only for the Soviet Union but for the western countries as well. The difference is that in the USSR the integration of modern methods of management and the usage of the engineering technologies into the industry of the country is regarded as a national program, which was headed by academician V.M.Glushkov.
</p>
<p>
That state program of the creation of an automatic control system involving the whole country is under control of the Communist Party; what's more it has caused appearance of a number of organizations managing the development of computer techniques and preparation of the professionals ready to work in this field. The Automatic Control Systems department becomes a significant part of this project.

The 80-ies have become an age of an unprecedented development of the computing technologies. The wide application of the microprocessors in the industry helps to decrease the price and the size of the new computers. The high school is drawn into the computer boom as well. 
</p>  
     
<p>
By 1976 a group of specialists working with students and dealing with the research work in the field of automation is formed at the Computer Engineering and Automated Management department; later this group will be reorganized as the staff of an Automatic Control Systems department. Having received necessary accommodation the new department headed by M.S. Her-Mkhitarov starts its work. 
</p>
<p>
A method of combined modeling of man-machine systems is designed by the researchers of the department who have to deal with merely everything connected with the process of running this type of techniques including full-scale experiments as well as educating the operators of the newly designed equipment
Practically the late 70-ies is the time when such systems as A\D Computer Complex, Automated Research Systems and Automated Educational Systems are developed. 
</p>
<H2>1978</H2>
<p>
The first computer of the ES series is finally designed and run by the Automatic Control Systems department; being placed at the territory of the Engineering faculty this computer deals with maintenance of the studying process of all the institute faculties as well as ASU-VUZ system processing (ASU-VUZ is an automated accounting system which helps to handle personal students data related with studying process).

The research laboratory of the Automatic Control Systems department is equipped with a modern third-generation computer "SM-1" - modern (in 1980) managing-purpose computer with an advanced peripheral communication system; this wide-oriented computer fills much less place than the old "Dnepr" that becomes second and has to give way to new equipment. 
<H2>1982</H2>
The research work of the Automatic Control Systems department is highly appreciated by the scientific community of the country and in 1982 the All-Union technical conference "Professional Skills Trainings" is conducted on the basis of the Electrotechnical Faculty.

Thus a new age in the history of the department has become. The institute has received "ES-1022" - the first computer, belonging to the unified series and the workers of the Automatic Control Systems Department have pledged themselves to master the computer and they've managed to do it successfully. Now the workers of the Automatic Control Systems department have an opportunity to exploit the computer 24 hours a day and what's more they used this opportunity at the full scale.

In the late 80-ies a new self-supported digital centre has united nearly all the computers of the institute and the Automatic Control Systems department together with the ASU-VUZ laboratory dealing with the control of the educational process have become its main users. It has become one of a few self-supported university digital centers in the country that dealt with scientific research as well as the problems of self-management of the center. 
</p>
<p>
Being the period of the formation of the world information handling industry the 80-ies become a time of the keen exploitation of the ES computers belonging to the IBM family of the compatible computers of the 3-rd generation.

The age of personal computing has brought to life such phenomenon as a personal automated workplace (workstation); and till the beginning of the nineties the ASU-VUZ laboratory headed by Alexander S. Podgorny had been occupied by the creation of automated workstations for dean's office, educational and other departments of the Institute. Bringing to life the automated workspace concept has limited the time taken by the information handling process because then the workers dealing with some problem have received an opportunity to use all the abilities of the modern equipment themselves without some specialists in the field of the digital technologies not aware of the peculiarities of the problem. Friendly interface, comfortable menu and display have changed the screen of a computer to the manager's worktable.
